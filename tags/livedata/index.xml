    <description><![CDATA[Why LiveData is the best solution (yet) for UI
As far as I am concerned, there are many developers who don&rsquo;t like LiveData. However, for the UI part, there is no better API to achieve MVVM (or even MVI,or stateful MVVM). Furthermore, makes the UI control very easy.
There might have been some small misconceptions regarding the usage of it, but, if you use LiveData for the purpose it was created, I think that&rsquo;s far better than any other API (for the moment).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I used to check the docs and just read a lot about flows but didn&rsquo;t implement anything until yesterday. However, the API tasted really cool (even though some operations are still in Experimental state).
Prerequisites: If you don&rsquo;t know RxJava it&rsquo;s fine. But a RxJava recognizer would read this faster.
Cold vs Hot streams
Well, I really struggled with this concept because it is a little bit tricky. The main difference between cold and hot happened to be pretty simple: Hot streams produce when you don&rsquo;t care while in cold streams, if you don&rsquo;t collect() (or RxJava-s equivalent subscribe()) the stream won&rsquo;t be activated at all.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This post is inspired by @EpicPandaForceÂ answer in StackOverflow. I faced the same problem which I didn&rsquo;t know how to solve: How to perform search when you are using a Paging Library (or how the hell to refresh after I reperform Rooms query)?
Let&rsquo;s suppose we have this scenario: I have a list of data, which are shown in the Fragment by LiveData observation, which are retrieved by the ViewModel through LiveDataPagedListBuilder().]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Conditional navigation is a little tricky when it comes to Navigation Architecture. There are plenty of nice articles and solutions about it, but I&rsquo;m sharing the way I solve this important problem. So let&rsquo;s consider this use case:

If you don&rsquo;t put HomeFragment as a start destination, you will have some serious trouble with the fragment back stack and you would need to write the onBackPressDispatcher in every fragment.]]></description>
