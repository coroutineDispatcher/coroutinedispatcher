    <description><![CDATA[The coroutines API has already brought some innovation in the Android and Kotlin world. I always loved the idea of keeping it as simple as we all can. There is a saying around here that &ldquo;Whoever talks to much, makes too much mistakes&rdquo; and I see this a little bit related to Java&rsquo;s verbosity and also in the world of concurrency.

I knew nothing about testing and this is my experience getting my hands dirty with it. Please feel free to correct anywhere I&rsquo;m wrong. This is a reason why I&rsquo;m writing blogs.
So what the hell is testing?
Testing is just a piece of code where you invoke your written production code and check its&rsquo; behavior.]]></description>
