    <description><![CDATA[Have you ever generated Kotlin docs (Kdocs) for your library/project? I have. There is a tool for this called Dokka and you can find it here. It&rsquo;s not too hard to set up.
I personally used Dokka for a small API i wrote for SharedPreferences. Anyways, the steps are pretty basic. One thing you must be careful though, is to know the syntax of the Kdocs pretty well (usually, if you know how to generate Javadoc, Kotlin docs don&rsquo;t have much difference).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Kotlin is a very a pretty nice adoptive language and user friendly. It really replaced Java from my everyday programming. However, it was not enough. We all know that groovy runs on JVM. So, why do I even need a new language just for my builds? Can&rsquo;t it be Java? So Java is the basic language for the JVM, Kotlin runs on JVM, Groovy runs on JVM and my build system has a separated language from my business logic system.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[When it comes to solving the Dependency Inversion principle, there is no better way then using annotations in the JVM world. However, generating code in compile time has some costs. For example the build time. And I believe this is the only thing dagger can&rsquo;t do well alone.
This is not a bye bye dagger post. This is mostly, obtaining the most out of Dagger.
To solve this problem, Dagger-Reflect was written.]]></description>
