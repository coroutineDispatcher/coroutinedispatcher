    <description><![CDATA[An Android Developer point of view.

I have never been a fan of cross-platforms until Flutter came by. Actually, it was my first experience with cross-platforms. Never have I ever tried React Native, Ionic or whatever. But what was intriguing about Flutter? Well, since I am a Google fan and a Native Android Developer, i thought I should give it a try.
Jumping into Flutter was pretty easy. They have simple documentation comparing to the Android Developers documentation, and I think it has a lot more details and better best-practices.]]></description>

Note: Chose to use the simplest set up without gradle or maven. You are free to chose what you like.
First of all, you start with a new project in your IntelliJ and choose Kotlin -&gt; Javascript.]]></description>
