    <description><![CDATA[onCreate As many of us might know, Realm has already introduced freezing objects. Personally, I have been waiting for long time for such feature. So, what actual problem does this solve?
A lot of us might have faced this issue:
Realm access from incorrect thread. Realm objects can only be accessed on the thread they were created. I believe the error speaks for itself.

    <description><![CDATA[Have you ever generated Kotlin docs (Kdocs) for your library/project? I have. There is a tool for this called Dokka and you can find it here. It&rsquo;s not too hard to set up.
I personally used Dokka for a small API i wrote for SharedPreferences. Anyways, the steps are pretty basic. One thing you must be careful though, is to know the syntax of the Kdocs pretty well (usually, if you know how to generate Javadoc, Kotlin docs don&rsquo;t have much difference).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Kotlin is a very a pretty nice adoptive language and user friendly. It really replaced Java from my everyday programming. However, it was not enough. We all know that groovy runs on JVM. So, why do I even need a new language just for my builds? Can&rsquo;t it be Java? So Java is the basic language for the JVM, Kotlin runs on JVM, Groovy runs on JVM and my build system has a separated language from my business logic system.]]></description>
