    <description><![CDATA[onCreate As many of us might know, Realm has already introduced freezing objects. Personally, I have been waiting for long time for such feature. So, what actual problem does this solve?
A lot of us might have faced this issue:
Realm access from incorrect thread. Realm objects can only be accessed on the thread they were created. I believe the error speaks for itself.

    <title>Why LiveData is the best solution (yet) for UI</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Why LiveData is the best solution (yet) for UI
As far as I am concerned, there are many developers who don&rsquo;t like LiveData. However, for the UI part, there is no better API to achieve MVVM (or even MVI,or stateful MVVM). Furthermore, makes the UI control very easy.
There might have been some small misconceptions regarding the usage of it, but, if you use LiveData for the purpose it was created, I think that&rsquo;s far better than any other API (for the moment).]]></description>

    <title>Fragments ❤  ViewPager2</title>

    <description><![CDATA[The ViewPager2 is a pretty nice rework of the ViewPager API. Some new features you may find with the ViewPager2 are:
1- Vertical scrolling. You can simply enable it by adding: android:orientation=&quot;vertical&rdquo; in the tag in your xml file.
2- Right to left support: you can set the android:layoutDirection=&quot;rtl&rdquo; to enable this.
3- Support for DiffUtil, because it is based on RecyclerView.
4 - Fragments improved support, which we will talk about below.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The dark mode, perhaps is one of the easiest functionality to implement without breaking literally anything in existing project. However, it has it&rsquo;s own hidden costs, tricks. Before implementing the Dark mode, what is most important is that your project must be ready for dark mode.
What I had:

What I wanted to achieve:

The setup:
The only thing you need to do to get your app ready for dark mode is the themes tag and the AppCompatDelegate class.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[While the Android architecture made development simpler, we should always be aware of the Lifecycle and with that, the right way to provide ViewModels. Creating one ViewModel factory for each Fragment and ViewModel you have is really expensive, bad architecture, and too much unnecessary code. Not to mention the fact that you should care about scopes, dependencies, components modules when using Dagger for DI.
You can have a simple &ldquo;generic&rdquo; ViewModel factory for all your app as a Singleton, with the help of Kotlin Reflection and Daggers Multibinding.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Testing, testing testing. I was getting inside the &ldquo;Fear of getting behind&rdquo; every time I heard that word. So I decided to react quickly. I knew nothing about testing and this is my experience getting my hands dirty with it. Please feel free to correct anywhere I&rsquo;m wrong. This is a reason why I&rsquo;m writing blogs.
So what the hell is testing?
Testing is just a piece of code where you invoke your written production code and check its&rsquo; behavior.]]></description>
