    <description><![CDATA[onCreate As many of us might know, Realm has already introduced freezing objects. Personally, I have been waiting for long time for such feature. So, what actual problem does this solve?
A lot of us might have faced this issue:
Realm access from incorrect thread. Realm objects can only be accessed on the thread they were created. I believe the error speaks for itself.

    <description><![CDATA[Why LiveData is the best solution (yet) for UI
As far as I am concerned, there are many developers who don&rsquo;t like LiveData. However, for the UI part, there is no better API to achieve MVVM (or even MVI,or stateful MVVM). Furthermore, makes the UI control very easy.
There might have been some small misconceptions regarding the usage of it, but, if you use LiveData for the purpose it was created, I think that&rsquo;s far better than any other API (for the moment).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Callbacks in Java are probably the most basic way to perform executions/send actions between classes. If you have chosen to use coroutines in a project, you want to keep the same style everywhere. But what if some of the libraries you use, are still using callbacks?
No worries, Kotlin coroutines are easily integrated with callbacks. It&rsquo;s just a small workaround to make.
Let&rsquo;s think of a very simple use case:]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I used to check the docs and just read a lot about flows but didn&rsquo;t implement anything until yesterday. However, the API tasted really cool (even though some operations are still in Experimental state).
Prerequisites: If you don&rsquo;t know RxJava it&rsquo;s fine. But a RxJava recognizer would read this faster.
Cold vs Hot streams
Well, I really struggled with this concept because it is a little bit tricky. The main difference between cold and hot happened to be pretty simple: Hot streams produce when you don&rsquo;t care while in cold streams, if you don&rsquo;t collect() (or RxJava-s equivalent subscribe()) the stream won&rsquo;t be activated at all.]]></description>
