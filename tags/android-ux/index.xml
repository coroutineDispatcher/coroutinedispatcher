    <description><![CDATA[Details matter especially when it comes to making users happy. We have all kinds of users, those who don&rsquo;t care how the app is designed (just do what he/she needs), those who care, and those who are developers themselves. I have met people who don&rsquo;t use a single app just because it has some strange animation, and they hate it.
For me, it&rsquo;s a little from both. I Like seeing a minimalist design (like Airbnb Android app, which is one of my favorites, for instance), but it is also important to fulfill your needs also.]]></description>
